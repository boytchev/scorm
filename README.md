> “Patience is not the ability to wait, but the ability to keep a good attitude while waiting.”


This repository and its documentation are currently under construction. Be patient, please. The first version should be ready by the end of June 2022.

## LMS Info

This SCO is used for experiments with SCORM 1.2-complient LMS. It shows the list of elements passed from the LMS to the SCORM. The elements that are read-write can be modified and sent back to the LMS.


## Color hues

<img src="src/color-hues/images/snapshot.jpg" width="200" style="float:right;"> This is the first (in the world) SCO that uses [Suica](https://boytchev.github.io/suica/) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It is used to evaluate how well a user distinguishes color hues.
